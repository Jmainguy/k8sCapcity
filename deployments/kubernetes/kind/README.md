k8scapcity gathers information from a number of sources, one of those sources is metrics-server.

kinD kubernetes server which I am using to test, does not come with this pre-installed. So this directory is to set that up.

kind-metrics-server.yaml is slightly modified from a gist, in a comment, https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/398
